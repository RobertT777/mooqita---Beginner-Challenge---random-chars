# mooqita---Beginner-Challenge---random-chars

Generates 15 random characters/numbers and appends the line to a temp file
Once 1MB is reached, it stops appending to the temp file.
The temp file is then sorted with 'sort' and the output of that is sent to sed to remove the a and A characters.  
1925 lines began with A or a and were moved
